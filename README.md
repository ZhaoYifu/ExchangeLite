Enable batch operations of your Microsoft Exchange E-mails

With original E-mail client -- Microsoft Outlook, It may be somewhat unconvenient to batch-operate your emails. I mean, sometimes you may expect to download all attachments reside in all emails under a certain DIR or forward all emails of a directory just with a single click.

ExchangeLite will make you free to batch-download or batch-forward emails of Microsoft Exchange!

Core tool used in ExchangeLite is the Exchange Web Services client library -- Exchangelib. For detailed information about it please refer to https://pypi.org/project/exchangelib/
